**** Updating permissions for V13F27-336_C1 ****
Wed Nov  8 05:32:54 PM EST 2023

**** Note that warning/error messages are expected for files and directories that you are not the owner of.
The expected warning/error messages are: 
    'chgrp: changing group of ‘some_JHPCE_file_path’: Operation not permitted'
 or 'chmod: changing permissions of ‘some_JHPCE_file_path’: Operation not permitted'.
If for many files you are not the owner (creator of), you will get lots of these warning/error messages, this is expected!
Error or warnings with another syntax are likely real. ****

You will need to re-run this script anytime you upload files to JHPCE through Cyberduck / WinSCP as they break the ACLs.
Every new team member on a given project will likely also need to run this script once.

For more details about setting permissions at JHPCE using ACLs, please check https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/organizing-your-work.html#setting-jhpce-file-permissions.

This message will be displayed for 90 seconds before the script proceeds.
That way you will have time enough to read it and/or copy it.
